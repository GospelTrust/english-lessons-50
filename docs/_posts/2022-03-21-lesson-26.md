Man | Do you have any plans for the holidays?
Woman | Not yet. But we're still talking about what we want to do. What are you doing?
Man | We're planning on going to an amusement park.
Woman | That should be a great time. What are you looking forward to most?
Man | I love the rides especially the roller coasters. I like to go fast.
Woman | I don't really like roller coasters. I prefer the slower rides.
Man | And how about the food?
Woman | I love the food. Especially the ice cream and candy.
Man | No kidding. That's the best.
Woman | Well, have a great time! And I went to see photos when you get back.
Man | I'll bring my camera. We should have some good ones.
