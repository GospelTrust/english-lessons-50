Man | Today is the first day of school. I need to take a photo for my mother.
Woman | What is she going to need that for?
Man | We have always taken a picture of us the first day of school. Every year since I was a kid.
Woman | Really! that's cool and what do you do with them?
Man | Nothing, but my parents have frames with our pictures from every year at home.
Woman | Why don't you take one of my two. I'll send it to my mom.
Man | Sounds great!
