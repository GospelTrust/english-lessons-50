Man | We're looking for the airport. Do you know where it is?
Woman | I do. I just flew in yesterday. I think I can help you.
Man | We got off the freeway at the last Street and I think we're close.
Woman | You are within several blocks of the road that will take you there. Will you also need to park your car.
Man | No. We'll be returning it. It's a rental car.
Woman | I'm glad you said that. You'll need to drive to a different location.
Man | Is it far?
Woman | No, but it's on the other side of the airport terminals.
Man | Great! How do I get there?
Woman | Do you have a city map?
Man | No
Woman | Ok. Turn left at the next major Street. And follow the signs to the rental agency.
Man | Great! Thank you! Have a nice day!
