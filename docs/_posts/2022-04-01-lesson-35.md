Man | My computer isn't working. Can you help me find a new one.
Woman | Sure. What kind of computer do you have?
Man | It was a laptop. I use it everyday for work.
Woman | May I ask what happened to it?
Man | I was at a coffee shop, and some guy spilled his coffee on it. After that, it just wouldn't turn on anymore.
Woman | Here are all off our newest laptops. Do you have any in mind?
Man | No, I just need one with a lot of memory space.
Woman | We have one with one terabyte of space. Will that be enough?
Man | One terabyte should be plenty. How much?
Woman | Six hundred dollars plus tax.
Man | Perfect! I'll take this one. Does it come in another colour?
Woman | Yes, Grey, Black, and White.
Man | Ok. I'll take a black one.
