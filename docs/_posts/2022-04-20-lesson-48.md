Man | Hi. I'm calling the dentist office. Is doctor Smith available?
Woman | At the moment doctor Smith is busy. Can you leave a message?
Man | Yes this is Sam. I was in the office last week. Today my tooth was really bothering me and I'd like to see the doctor again.
Woman | Ok, Sam. I remember you. He told me you had some pain from another cavity. Can you come in on Saturday?
Man | This Saturday?
Woman | Yes.
Man | I guess so. I need to get my tooth fixed as soon as possible.
Woman | Ok. We'll see you on Saturday.
Man | All right.
