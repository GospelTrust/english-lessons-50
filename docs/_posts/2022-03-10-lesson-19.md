Man | What's your favorite sport?
Woman | My favorite sport is basketball. I've been playing basketball since I was a kid.
Man | Do you like watching basketball or just playing it?
Woman | I like watching it. Playing it is also fun.
Man | Which team is your favourite?
Woman | I don't have a favorite team. I just watch all the games.
Man | But you should have a favorite team, right?
Woman | No. I like the Tigers a little because they won the Championship last year. But they are not my favorite.
Man | Well, we're going to the Tigers game next week. If you want to come let me know. We have an extra ticket.
Woman | I'd love to go. That would be fun!
