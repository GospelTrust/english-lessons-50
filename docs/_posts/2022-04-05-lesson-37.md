Speaker | Said
---: | :---
Man | I'm here to check out.
Woman | Great sir! How was your stay?
Man | It could've been much better.
Woman | May I ask how it could've been better?
Man | I thought my room included breakfast but you charged me for breakfast. The room next door was really loud. I called the front desk about it, but they didn't do anything about it.
Woman | I'm sorry to hear that sir.
Man | And my TV didn't work. I wanted to watch the game, but I missed it.
Woman | May we offer you a discount coupon. That sounds like a terrible experience.
Man | I guess that would be ok. I hope next time is much, much better.
