Man | Can you help me? I'm looking for a book.
Woman | Sure! what book are you looking for?
Man | It's called War.
Woman | Ok, what is the name of the author?
Man | The author's name is John Smith.
Woman | Ok, give me a second. Let me check to see if we have it. Ok, it looks like we don't have to book here. But we do have it in another store. Would you like to order it?
Man | Sure, that would be great!
Woman | We can have it here by Thursday. We'll save it for you.
Man | Excellent! I guess I'll be back on Thursday to pick it up.
