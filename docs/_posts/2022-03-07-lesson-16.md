Man | Do we have another test today?
Woman | Yes. Why?
Man | Well, we had one yesterday and again last week. I failed both of them. This class is so hard.
Woman | It would be a lot easier if you just did the homework.
Man | Yeah, with the homework takes way too long. I have other more important things to do.
Woman | Like what?
Man | Like play video games. They are way more fun.
Woman | Yeah! But video games don't help you get a job.
Man | Maybe, I can make money playing video games. If others have done it, I can do it too.
Woman | Ok. Good luck with that.
