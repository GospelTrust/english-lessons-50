Man | What happened to your hand?
Woman | I was cutting open a watermelon and then the knife slipped.
Man | Oh no! Was it a deep cut?
Woman | No, it looks worse than it is. I was bleeding a lot but now it's ok. It doesn't hurt very much.
Man | That's good. Be careful next time. Knives can be very dangerous.
