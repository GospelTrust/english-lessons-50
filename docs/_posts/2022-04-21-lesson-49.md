Woman | Housekeeping. May I come in?
Man | Just a minute! Ok, you can come in.
Woman | Is now a good time to clean your room or should I come back a little later?

Woman | Yes, there is.
Man | And could you do me a favour?
Woman | What is it.
Man | Can you give me some extra towels and one extra blanket?
