Man | I love this picture! Where was it taken?
Woman | This was taken last year. We went to the Bahamas for vacation.
Man | Where are you exactly in this picture?
Woman | We are in front of our hotel. It was five stars. Honestly it was the nicest hotel I've ever seen.
Man | That sounds so cool. And it looks like it is right next to the beach.
Woman | Yes, there was a private beach and a pool. And everything was included. Food, bar, everything.
Man | Wow, I want to go there so badly.
Woman | I think you should.
