Man | Excuse me, do you know where Walnut Street is?
Woman | Walnut Street? Hmmm. I've never heard of Walnut Street. Are you sure it's not Maple Street?
Man | Yeah this is my friend's house. He said his address is 25 Walnut Street.
Woman | Well, I don't know where that street is. Have you tried using the map on your phone?
Man | Yes, every time I type the address up, it just says error.
Woman | I think you should try 25 Maple Street. It's very close to here.
Man | Maybe I will. How do I get there?
Woman | Just follow this road until you get to the intersection and make a left turn. It's the first street. You'll see it.
Man | Thanks!
