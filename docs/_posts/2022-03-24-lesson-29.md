Woman | I just cleaned out my purse. It was getting too heavy to carry.
Man | What do you keep in that purse? What do you keep in it that weighs so much? Money?
Woman | I wish. I had 14 pens and several lipsticks. They grow in there if I didn't keep emptying it out.
Man | It must be a pain to carry a purse everywhere. I just have my wallet.
Woman | Actually, I enjoy having what I need with me. It just gets out of hand sometimes.
Man | Oh, really!
Woman | Yeah, so I cleaned it out and I'm good to go.
