Woman | Yes.
Man | it's beautiful. How long have you been working here?
Woman | I've been in this office for about 3 months.
Man | It looks brand new!
Woman | It was built about a year ago. It's pretty new.
Man | Your old office was old, who wasn't it?
Woman | Yes everything in that office was old. Even the electricity didn't work sometimes.
Man | That's terrible! But this office is so much better.
Woman | Yes, I finally decided it would be a good idea to move.
Man | Well, I think it was a great idea. This office is fantastic!
