Man | Why didn't you miss school yesterday? We had a test.
Woman | I was at home sick with the flu.
Man | You got the flu? That's terrible.
Woman | When I woke up I just felt really tired. I couldn't get out of bed.
Man | But we had a test. You missed it.
Woman | Oh no. I didn't remember we had a test. Do you think I can take it again?
Man | I don't know. Our teacher is very strict.
Woman | I hope so. I really need to pass the class.
Man | Maybe if you tell the teacher that you were sick, he'll let you take the test.
Woman | I'll ask him today.
