Man | I'm thinking about seeing a movie later today. Is there anything good out.
Woman | It depends on what kind of movie you like?
Man | I like comedies the most. Action movies are also good.
Woman | Do you like horror movies? There's a really good one out soon.
Man | No way! The last time I watched a horror movie, I got so scared that I couldn't sleep the whole night.
Woman | I guess you won't like that movie then.
Man | There's also a kungfu movie. I haven't seen it yet, but everyone says it's really good.
Woman | Maybe I'll see that one. I like the martial arts.
