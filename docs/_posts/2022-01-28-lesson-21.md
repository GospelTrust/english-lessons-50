Man | Do you have hurricanes where do you live?
Woman | Yes. Every once in a while we have a hurricane most of the time they are small.
Man | Do they ever do serious damage?
Woman | Yes. Sometimes we will have a very strong wind and it will knock down trees and cause damage to buildings.
Man | Has anyone gotten hurt?
Woman | Most times we have a hurricane everyone evacuate and we are all safe. But if you live on a beach it could be very dangerous.
Man | Why?
Woman | Because the waves get really big and it can flood.
Man | If I go there should I be worried?
Woman | No, you'll be fine. Hurricanes are rare and we know about them before they come.
