Man | I have good news.
Woman | Really? What happened?
Man | Remember that job interview that I had last weekend?
Woman | Yeah. You said it didn't go very well.
Man | Yeah, so I thought it was really bad. I was late. And I wore really small shirt.
Woman | I remember and you forgot your name.
Man | Yeah, I even forgot my name when that asked me. Well, I got the job, even though the interview was bad.
