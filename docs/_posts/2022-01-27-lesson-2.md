Speaker | Said
---: | :---
Man | Do you have a dog?
Woman | Yes! I have a beautiful golden retriever who I consider to be a family member.
Man | How long have you had it?
Woman | She has been in our family since she was a puppy. Goldy is 7 years old this year.
Man | Why did you name her Goldy?
Woman | Because she is golden, and her fur is soft and golden.
Man | That makes sense. Is she an indoor dog or an outdoor dog?
Woman | She stays with us in the house mostly, but she loves to chase birds outside.
Man | That must be fun for her but scary for the birds outside.
Woman | I don't think she would hurt a bird, but she likes to chase them.
Man | I've thought about getting a dog.
Woman | Good idea! You'd love it! They are very entertaining.
