Woman | I like your haircut. How did you choose your new style?
Man | I didn't. The barber did. I thought he would know best.
Woman | He did a good job. How do you like having shorter hair?
Man | It's ok. I know it'll grow out. But I might keep it this way. ...Several people have said they liked it too.
Woman | Would you recommend him to cut my hair. I need a haircut too. But I don't have a barber in the city yet.
Man | Sure. I think you'll like him. They also provide other services. ...and they have tvs so you won't get bored when they cut your hair.
Woman | That sounds great! Can you give me his number?
Man | Sure! Here it is. Good luck!
