Man | Wow! the weather is nice today, isn's it?
Woman | Absolutely! Just look at it. The skies are so clear.
Man | I think you can even see part of the moon too.
Woman | So what are you planning on doing later today?
Man | I was thinking I may go to the park and ride my bike. Last time I rode my bike it started raining. I got soaked.
Woman | I remember that you were completely drenched.
Man | Even my phone got wet but I bought a cover so it still works just fine.
