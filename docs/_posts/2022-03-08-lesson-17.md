Man | I hate rainy days. Everytime it rains, my hair gets all wet.
Woman | Well! Why don't you take an umbrella?
Man | I do take an umbrella. But it still gets wet.
Woman | I love rainy days.
Man | What! Why?
Woman | Because when it rains I can stay inside and drink some warm hot chocolate by the fire. After it rains all the plants and trees turn green.
Man | Not in the winter.
Woman | Well it depends on where you live. I live in Hawaii. It rains a lot but it is never too cold there.
Man | I'm from Colorado. We have cold rain and then it snows. I hate snow too.
Woman | What! You don't like the snow?
Man | I like a little snow. But when we have snow every day for three months it gets old and it's freezing.
Woman | Well, maybe we should switch places.
Man | That's a good idea.
