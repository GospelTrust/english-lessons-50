Woman | Would you tell me about your family?
Man | What would you like to know?
Woman | Do you have brothers and sisters?
Man | I have one sister and two brothers. One brother is older. And the other is younger.
Woman | And how about your parents? Are they living?
Man | Yes my mother lives here several blocks from my home. My father lives with my stepmother in another city.
Woman | Do you see them often?
Man | Who? My parents or my siblings?
Woman | All of them.
Man | I see my mother and sister every week for dinner. And I only see my brother is for special holidays. My dad is usually busy with his wife's family and they don't like to travel.
Woman | Well, that's great your mother and sister are so close. Family means a lot.
