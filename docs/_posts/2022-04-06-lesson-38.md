Man | What time is it?
Woman |  It is 5:30. Why?
Man | I think I'm going to be late. I have a meeting at 5:45.
Woman | Late! Why?  You still have 15 minutes. That's plenty of time.
Man | No it isn't. It's Tuesday. Today there is so much traffic.
Woman | How long does it normally take to get there?
Man | Normally it takes 10 minutes. But if there's traffic it'll take more than 30 minutes. A half an hour!
Woman | Well, since you were already late, why not just stay here? Can you miss your meeting?
Man | Yeah, it's not that important. I'll just call them and tell them that I won't make it today.
Woman | Sure, and you can leave earlier next time.
