Man | Hey Jane. Could you do me a big favor?
Woman | Absolutely! What do you need?
Man | I have a big report that I need to print out. But I just found out that my printer is completely out of ink. Can you go to the store and buy me some ink. I need black ink and color ink.
Woman | Ok. How much will it cost.
Man | It should be almost 50 dollars. I can reimburse you later is that ok?
Woman | Sure!
Man | And could you pick up white paper too? I'm running low on that.
Woman | Sure. So I'll get ink and white paper.
Man | Yes. And I'll pay you back tomorrow.
Woman | I'll expect that.
