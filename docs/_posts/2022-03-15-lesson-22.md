Man | Yes it's John Roberts. I'll be there on the second. I think its a Tuesday. Until Friday. I check out Friday morning.
Woman | Great! Would you like a smoking or non-smoking room?
Man | Non-smoking please. I can't stand the smell of smoke. Could I also get a room with a view?
Woman | That would be no problem, sir. Ok, see you have a reservation for Tuesday for three nights.
Man | Excellent. I'll see you on Tuesday.
