Man | Wow! You look great today. What's the occasion?
Woman | Thanks. I found this shirt on sale and I had to have it. It was 75% off!
Man | That's so cheap. What about the shorts?
Woman | The shorts were a little more expensive. But they are so comfortable. And I like the colour.
Man | And the shoes? Are the shoes new?
Woman | These shoes? I've had them for several months but I don't wear them very often so they still look new.
Man | I need to go buy some new clothes as well.
Woman | Maybe I'll go to the same place. Is there still on sale?
Man | Yes, there is on sale this whole month.
Woman | I'll go tomorrow.
