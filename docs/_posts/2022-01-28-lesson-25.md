Woman | Have you seen my blue dress?
Man | I've seen a green dress but not a blue dress. Which blue dress are you talking about?
Woman | You know, the blue dress I wore to Kathy's party.
Man | Oh that blue dress. I haven't seen it in a long time. Not since the party.
Woman | I really like that dress, but I have no idea where it is.
Man | Where did you see it last?
Woman | Maybe in the car. Oh, I think it's in the car.
Man | Go check and see.
Woman | Here it is. It was in the trunk of the car the whole time.
