Man | Today is the day we sign up for classes. What are you going to take this semester?
Woman | Well, my major is economics so I'll need to take some accounting classes.
Man | What about calculus? Did you already do calculus?
Woman | Yes! I took it last semester. It was so easy. I like math. Have you taken it yet?
Man | No, I hate math. I think I have to take it this semester though.
Woman | Do you need the text book? I can give you mine.
Man | Sure. That would be great! Text books are so expensive these days.
